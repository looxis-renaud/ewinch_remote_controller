The "monitor" (monitor.ino) is basically an additional Lilygo LoRa ESP 32 that just listens
to LoRa communication between transmitter and receiver and displays
data on the oled display. I am "playing around" to add an external round oled or squared TFT Display
for displaying the data nicely on a bigger screen (bigger than the original oled of the ESP32 Lora board)
